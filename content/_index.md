I am an Associate Professor of Reliable Hardware and Software Systems at the [Institut für Datentechnik und Kommunikationsnetze](https://www.ida.ing.tu-bs.de/home) at [TU Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/).

My research topics include low-power system design, IoT networks, and artificial intelligence. You can find a summary of my research topics and main projects [here](https://andresgomez.ch/web/research/), or on the [BatterylessLab](https://batterylesslab.com/web/) website.

Previously, I was an IPF Postdoctoral Fellow at [Universität St.Gallen](http://www.unisg.ch/), working with [Prof. Simon Mayer](https://www.unisg.ch/en/personenverzeichnis/9b09ef4d-be68-4267-bb2b-b2a22e75e3cb). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2018 at [ETH Zürich](http://www.ethz.ch/), working under the joint supervision of [Prof. Luca Benini](https://www.ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.html?persid=194234) and [Prof. Lothar Thiele](http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~thiele/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Site/Home). I received a master’s degree in embedded system design at [Alari](http://www.alari.ch/) in Lugano, Switzerland. I also hold a dual bachelor’s degree in electronics and systems engineering, with a double minor in physics and management, all from [Universidad de Los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) in Bogotá, Colombia.
