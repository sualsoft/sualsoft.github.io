### Courses

At the University of St. Gallen, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:
 **Introduction to Computer Systems and Networking** (2020-2021)
 **Computer Networks and Distributed Systems** (2021-2022)
 **Ubiquitous Computing and the Internet of Things** (2021-2022)

At ETH Zurich, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:
 **Hardware/Software Codesign** (2015-2016)
 **VLSI 1** (2016-2017)
 **P&S â€“ Programming Microcontrollers** (2015-2017)

I have also coordinated the following courses:
 **VLSI 2** (2015-2018)

### Student Projects

I engage with many student projects on a variety of subjects, ranging from embedded machine learning, energy-driven hardware platforms, and low-power wireless protocols. During my time as a researcher, I have co-advised over 40 bachelor/master student projects. From those projects, roughly one-third have led to a publication co-authored with students. Nine of my advisees successfully transitioned into a PhD program in Switzerland and Germany, and one received an ETH Medal for outstanding work.
